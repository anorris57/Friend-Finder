# Friend-Finder
Using Node and Express Servers build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. 
This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. 
By determining the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:

   * Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`).
   * With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the `totalDifference`.
     * Example: 
       * User 1: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * User 2: `[3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * Total Difference: **2 + 1 + 2 =** **_5_**
   * Remember to use the absolute value of the differences. Put another way: no negative solutions! Your app should calculate both `5-3` and `3-5` as `2`, and so on. 
   * The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match with a modal.
